# LingoLearn : Demo Experience

## About LingoLearn
LingoLearn is a single-page web application created as a group project in the first half of the NewForce cirriculum. The original project called for each member of a team to choose from one of 4 languages, create a page for info about that language, and include a translation bar that accepted 10 or so default phrases to translate. After finishing this group project, I created my own branch to add stretch goals. First, LingoLearn now includes an speech-synthesized audio tanslation upon clicking the Translate button. Second, the translation bar is hooked up to the API at [Yandex.Translate](https://translate.yandex.com/), and is able to dynamically translate much more than the initial 10 static phrases. I also added 3 more language pages, to experiment with the API and speech synthesis.

## Installing and Running LingoLearn
1. Visit [the LingoLearn GitHub page](https://github.com/dylbyl/newForceTranslationDemo/) and clone the repository to a local branch. 
2. Open the root folder in a code editor capable of running HTML/CSS/JavaScript files, preferably Visual Studio Code with the LiveServer extension installed. 
3. Clicking "Go Live" at the bottom of such an editor will open LingoLearn in a new browser window.

# Testing the Web App
When first launching the app, you'll be taken to a new browser window that's mostly blank, save for a navigation bar at the top. Clicking any language in the nav bar will bring you to a page showing various fun facts. At the bottom of each page is a translation bar. You can type anything into this bar and click "Translate" to hear a speech-synthesized translation accompanied by a text translation (powered by [Yandex.Translate](https://translate.yandex.com/)). Try translating various phrases on each language's page, and have fun!
